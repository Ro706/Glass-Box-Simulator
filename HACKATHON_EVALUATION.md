# Algorithmic Glass Box Simulator - Hackathon Evaluation Guide

**DEI × Virtual Labs Hackathon 2026**

---

## 1. Project Overview

### What is the project?

**Algorithmic Glass Box Simulator** is an interactive web-based educational platform that transforms pathfinding algorithms from abstract black boxes into transparent, step-by-step learning experiences. The platform visualizes four fundamental algorithms—BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* (A-Star)—enabling students to watch algorithms execute in real-time on dynamically drawn grids.

### What problem does it solve?

Current CS education presents algorithms as static formulas and pseudocode snippets, leaving students with memorized procedures but limited intuition. Students struggle to:
- Understand *why* an algorithm makes specific decisions
- Visualize the internal state of data structures during execution
- Compare algorithm behaviors side-by-side
- Apply theoretical knowledge to practical problem-solving
- Build confidence in implementing algorithms correctly

### One-line value proposition

**Demystify how pathfinding algorithms work through interactive visualization, step-by-step explanations, and hands-on experiential learning.**

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### What is the core problem?

Pathfinding algorithms are fundamental to computer science, yet teaching them remains predominantly lecture-based and theoretical. Students encounter:
1. **Black-box learning**: Algorithms presented as finished procedures without revealing internal logic
2. **Passive visualization**: Static diagrams that don't reflect algorithm behavior on varied inputs
3. **Lack of intuition**: No mechanism to build mental models of data structure evolution
4. **Insufficient comparison tools**: Difficulty understanding trade-offs between different algorithms
5. **Limited accessibility**: Text-heavy learning excludes students with different learning modalities

### Why is this a problem in current CS education?

- Algorithm courses rely on pseudocode and whiteboards, which don't capture real-time dynamics
- Students memorize algorithm steps but cannot explain *why* those steps are necessary
- Online judges (LeetCode, Codeforces) test implementation but provide no learning scaffold
- Traditional teaching fails to engage kinesthetic and visual learners
- No unified platform combines visualization, theory, practice, and comparison

### Why does this problem exist today?

1. **Tooling gap**: Existing visualizers (VisuAlgo, Algorithm Visualizer) are either read-only demos or lack integration with learning theory
2. **Isolation of resources**: Theory notes, code, visualizations, and practice problems exist in silos (textbooks, GitHub, LeetCode)
3. **One-size-fits-all approach**: No platform adapts to individual learning pace or provides context-aware tutoring
4. **Accessibility barriers**: Limited support for diverse learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)

## 7. System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The application follows a **modular, client-side architecture** with 4 main layers:

| Layer | Key Components | Purpose |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| **UI Layer** | React components (GridCanvas, Playback Controls, Data Structure Viewer, Explanation Panel) | User interface and interactions |
| **State Management** | Zustand stores (simulatorStore, comparisonStore) | Manages algorithm state, grid state, playback state |
| **Algorithm Engine** | Pure functions (bfs.ts, dfs.ts, dijkstra.ts, astar.ts) | Step-by-step algorithm execution |
| **Learning Layer** | Content (algorithmContent.ts), TTS, AI Tutor, LeetCode links | Educational content and support |

### How It Works

**Simple Data Flow**:

1. User interacts with UI (clicks button, draws grid)
2. UI dispatches action to Zustand store
3. Store calls algorithm function
4. Algorithm returns next state (grid, frontier, explanation)
5. Components re-render with updated visualization
6. TTS narrates explanation; Tutor answers questions

**Example**: User clicks "Step Forward" → Store calls `bfs()` → Algorithm returns next state → GridCanvas recolors cells → DataStructureViewer updates → ExplanationPanel displays text → TextToSpeech narrates

### Key Integration Points

- **Grid Visualization**: Canvas API renders real-time grid updates
- **State Persistence**: Zustand manages algorithm progress across steps
- **Audio Feedback**: Web Speech API narrates each step
- **External Services**: LeetCode links and optional Gemini API for off-topic questions

3. **Reusability**: Modular codebase can be extended to cover entire CS curriculum (sorting, graphs, dynamic programming, etc.)
4. **Open Source**: Can be contributed to Virtual Labs ecosystem; helps other educators create similar tools

---

## 14. Alignment with Virtual Labs Mission

### How this solution supports experiential learning

**Virtual Labs Mission**: *"Provide hands-on, interactive learning experiences that transform passive consumption into active discovery."*

**Alignment**:

1. **Hands-On Exploration**: Students don't passively watch videos; they:
   - Draw custom mazes and grids
   - Step through algorithms at their pace
   - Inspect intermediate states (frontier, visited, costs)
   - Compare algorithms side-by-side
   - This is **active experiential learning**

2. **Feedback Loop**: Each action (step, pause, reset, inspect) generates immediate visual feedback
   - Users learn causality: *"When I step forward, this frontier changes because..."*
   - Builds mental models through iterative refinement

3. **Discovery-Based**: Users discover *why* algorithms work, not just *how*
   - Tutor asks guiding questions: "Why is this node chosen next?"
   - Users experiment: "What happens if I move the goal?"
   - Active sense-making, not passive instruction

4. **Multi-Modal Engagement**: Combines visual, auditory, kinesthetic, textual learning
   - Aligns with Virtual Labs' inclusive design philosophy

### Why it fits into the Virtual Labs ecosystem

**Virtual Labs as a Platform**:
- Virtual Labs hosts simulations for physics, chemistry, electronics, etc.
- **Algorithmic Glass Box** extends this to **computer science education**
