### What is the project?

**Algorithmic Glass Box Simulator** is an interactive web-based educational platform that transforms pathfinding algorithms from abstract black boxes into transparent, step-by-step learning experiences. The platform visualizes four fundamental algorithms—BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* (A-Star)—enabling students to watch algorithms execute in real-time on dynamically drawn grids.

### What problem does it solve?

Current CS education presents algorithms as static formulas and pseudocode snippets, leaving students with memorized procedures but limited intuition. Students struggle to:
- Understand *why* an algorithm makes specific decisions
- Visualize the internal state of data structures during execution
- Compare algorithm behaviors side-by-side
- Apply theoretical knowledge to practical problem-solving
- Build confidence in implementing algorithms correctly

### One-line value proposition

**Demystify how pathfinding algorithms work through interactive visualization, step-by-step explanations, and hands-on experiential learning.**

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### What is the core problem?

Pathfinding algorithms are fundamental to computer science, yet teaching them remains predominantly lecture-based and theoretical. Students encounter:
1. **Black-box learning**: Algorithms presented as finished procedures without revealing internal logic
2. **Passive visualization**: Static diagrams that don't reflect algorithm behavior on varied inputs
3. **Lack of intuition**: No mechanism to build mental models of data structure evolution
4. **Insufficient comparison tools**: Difficulty understanding trade-offs between different algorithms
5. **Limited accessibility**: Text-heavy learning excludes students with different learning modalities

### Why is this a problem in current CS education?

- Algorithm courses rely on pseudocode and whiteboards, which don't capture real-time dynamics
- Students memorize algorithm steps but cannot explain *why* those steps are necessary
- Online judges (LeetCode, Codeforces) test implementation but provide no learning scaffold
- Traditional teaching fails to engage kinesthetic and visual learners
- No unified platform combines visualization, theory, practice, and comparison

### Why does this problem exist today?

1. **Tooling gap**: Existing visualizers (VisuAlgo, Algorithm Visualizer) are either read-only demos or lack integration with learning theory
2. **Isolation of resources**: Theory notes, code, visualizations, and practice problems exist in silos (textbooks, GitHub, LeetCode)
3. **One-size-fits-all approach**: No platform adapts to individual learning pace or provides context-aware tutoring
4. **Accessibility barriers**: Limited support for diverse learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)

### How components interact

1. **User Input → UI Layer**: User interacts with grid, controls, or selectors
2. **UI → Store**: Component dispatches action to Zustand store (e.g., `setAlgorithm()`, `stepForward()`)
3. **Store → Algorithm Engine**: Store triggers algorithm function (e.g., `bfs()`, `dijkstra()`)
4. **Algorithm Engine → Store**: Engine returns next step state (grid, frontier, visited, explanation)
5. **Store → Visualization**: Canvas component re-renders grid with updated colors
6. **Explanation Module**: TTS reads explanation text; AI tutor answers contextual questions
7. **External Services**: LeetCode links open in new tab; Gemini answers off-topic questions (optional)

### Data Flow Example: User Steps Algorithm Forward

```
User clicks "Step Forward" button
    │
    ├─> PlaybackControls.tsx triggers simulatorStore.stepForward()
    │
    ├─> simulatorStore calls algorithm(grid, state) → AlgorithmStep
    │
    ├─> AlgorithmStep contains:
    │   • Updated grid (with visited/frontier/current colors)
    │   • Current node being explored
    │   • Frontier queue/stack/priority-queue
    │   • Visited set
    │   • Reconstructed path
    │   • Human-readable explanation string
    │
    ├─> Store updates React state
    │
    ├─> Components re-render:
    │   • GridCanvas: Recolors cells
    │   • DataStructureViewer: Updates frontier display
    │   • ExplanationPanel: Shows explanation text
    │   • MetricsDisplay: Updates counter
    │   • TextToSpeech: Speaks new explanation (if enabled)
    │
    └─> User sees algorithm progression
```

## 12. Challenges & Limitations

### Current limitations of the product

| Limitation | Reason | Future Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **4 algorithms only** | Scope constraint; focused on pathfinding | Extend to sorting (quicksort, mergesort), tree traversals, DP algorithms |
| **2D grid pathfinding** | Foundational scope; real-world often uses graphs | Add graph input (edge list, adjacency matrix) |
| **No collaborative features** | Single-user design | Add multiplayer mode, shared demo sessions, classroom sharing |
| **Gemini API optional** | Cost; privacy; some users may not want external calls | Build custom fallback tutor; fine-tune smaller model |
| **No offline mode** | Web-based; requires internet | Implement Service Worker for offline algorithm execution |
| **No progress tracking** | Stateless app; no user accounts | Add backend + authentication for learning history, achievements |
| **Limited problem curation** | Manual LeetCode links | Integrate LeetCode API for real-time problem recommendations |
| **No adaptive difficulty** | One-size-fits-all approach | Implement adaptive learning path based on user performance |

### Technical or scope constraints

1. **Canvas Performance**: Grids larger than 100×100 may have lag on low-end devices
2. **Algorithm Complexity**: A* with large heuristic error can explore many nodes (worst-case O(b^d))
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Older browsers (IE11) not supported; Web Speech API limited on some browsers
4. **Explanation Generation**: Hand-authored explanations limit scalability; AI-generated text may lack nuance
5. **LeetCode Integration**: Uses direct problem links; no real-time difficulty/rating integration

### Alignment with Virtual Labs expansion

This project aligns with Virtual Labs' mission in three ways:

1. **Experiential Learning**: Interactive visualization + hands-on exploration embodies Virtual Labs' core pedagogy
2. **Accessibility & Inclusivity**: Free, web-based, accessible to students globally; supports diverse learning styles (DEI alignment)
3. **Reusability**: Modular codebase can be extended to cover entire CS curriculum (sorting, graphs, dynamic programming, etc.)
4. **Open Source**: Can be contributed to Virtual Labs ecosystem; helps other educators create similar tools

---

## 14. Alignment with Virtual Labs Mission

### How this solution supports experiential learning

**Virtual Labs Mission**: *"Provide hands-on, interactive learning experiences that transform passive consumption into active discovery."*

**Alignment**:

1. **Hands-On Exploration**: Students don't passively watch videos; they:
   - Draw custom mazes and grids
   - Step through algorithms at their pace
   - Inspect intermediate states (frontier, visited, costs)
   - Compare algorithms side-by-side
   - This is **active experiential learning**

2. **Feedback Loop**: Each action (step, pause, reset, inspect) generates immediate visual feedback
   - Users learn causality: *"When I step forward, this frontier changes because..."*
   - Builds mental models through iterative refinement

3. **Discovery-Based**: Users discover *why* algorithms work, not just *how*
   - Tutor asks guiding questions: "Why is this node chosen next?"
   - Users experiment: "What happens if I move the goal?"
   - Active sense-making, not passive instruction

4. **Multi-Modal Engagement**: Combines visual, auditory, kinesthetic, textual learning
   - Aligns with Virtual Labs' inclusive design philosophy

### Why it fits into the Virtual Labs ecosystem

**Virtual Labs as a Platform**:
- Virtual Labs hosts simulations for physics, chemistry, electronics, etc.
- **Algorithmic Glass Box** extends this to **computer science education**
- Fills a gap: no existing Virtual Labs tool for algorithm visualization

**Modularity & Reusability**:
- Codebase designed to scale: can add sorting, graph algorithms, DP
- Architecture template for other CS simulations
- Contributes to Virtual Labs' growing library

**Open Source Contribution**:
- Code released under open license (MIT/Apache)
- Educators can fork, modify, extend
- Community contributions improve tool over time

**DEI Alignment**:
- **Free and accessible**: No paywall; works on any device
- **Inclusive design**: Accessible to diverse learners (visual, auditory, motor, cognitive)
- **Languages**: Easily translatable; can serve global audience
- **No prerequisites**: Beginner-friendly; lowers barrier to CS learning
