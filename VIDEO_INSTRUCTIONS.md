## 🎥 COMPLETE VIDEO SCRIPT

### **SECTION 1: OPENING & INTRO (0:30)**

#### Slide 1: Title Card (0:00-0:10)
**Visual**: Show the Algorithmic Glass Box Simulator home page
**Text on Screen**: "Algorithmic Glass Box Simulator"
**Voiceover**:
> "Welcome to the Algorithmic Glass Box Simulator - the interactive tool that transforms how you learn pathfinding algorithms."

#### Slide 2: Main Theme (0:10-0:30)
**Visual**: Highlight the "Launch Simulator" button
**Text on Screen**: "Stop Learning as Black Boxes"
**Voiceover**:
> "Say goodbye to memorizing algorithm steps. With this simulator, you'll see inside every algorithm, understand how they work, and build real intuition through hands-on practice."

---

### **SECTION 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT (0:45)**

#### Slide 1: The Problem (0:30-1:00)
**Visual**: Click "Launch Simulator"
**Wait for load**
**Text on Screen**: "The Learning Challenge"
**Voiceover**:
> "Learning algorithms is tough. Traditional teaching shows you the result, but not how we got there. Students struggle with three things:"

#### Slide 2: Three Pain Points (1:00-1:15)
**Visual**: Point to the blank grid
**Display three points on screen**:
```
1. Algorithms feel magical with no visibility
2. Data structures are hard to visualize
3. Theory and practice feel disconnected
```
**Voiceover**:
> "First, algorithms seem magical - you don't see the decision-making process. Second, data structures like queues and stacks are invisible. Third, learning theory in textbooks doesn't connect to real coding practice."

---

### **SECTION 3: FEATURE 1 - INTERACTIVE SIMULATOR (1:00)**

#### Slide 1: Setting Up the Grid (1:15-1:40)
**Visual**: 
- Click on a cell to set the START point (turns blue)
- Click another cell to set the END point (turns red)
**Text on Screen**: "Click to set Start & End Points"
**Voiceover**:
> "Let's start with the interactive grid. It's simple: click any cell to set your starting point - it turns blue. Click another to set your destination - it turns red. You can place these anywhere on the grid."

#### Slide 2: Drawing Obstacles (1:40-1:55)
**Visual**: 
- Click and DRAG across multiple cells to draw walls (black)
- Draw a small maze pattern
**Text on Screen**: "Drag to Draw Walls"
**Voiceover**:
> "Next, you can draw obstacles by clicking and dragging. This creates walls that algorithms must navigate around. You can make simple paths or complex mazes - the choice is yours."

#### Slide 3: Selecting and Running Algorithms (1:55-2:15)
**Visual**: 
- Click the Algorithm Selector dropdown
- Show all 4 options: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*
- Select one (e.g., BFS)
- Click the PLAY button
- Watch the algorithm execute with animations
**Text on Screen**: "Select Algorithm & Watch Execution"
**Voiceover**:
> "Now select your algorithm from the dropdown. We have four pathfinding algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and A-star. Choose one and hit play. Watch as the algorithm explores the grid in real-time. Yellow cells show the frontier - where it's currently exploring. Faded cells show visited areas. And when it finds the path? It highlights the solution in green."

**Pause the execution mid-way through**

---

### **SECTION 4: FEATURE 2 - ALGORITHM NOTES & THEORY (0:45)**

#### Slide 1: Accessing Notes (2:15-2:30)

#### Slide 2: What's in Notes (2:30-2:50)
**Visual**: 
- Scroll through the Notes content showing:
  1. Definition section
  2. Pseudocode section
  3. JavaScript code implementation
  4. Flow diagram with Mermaid notation
  5. Real-world use cases
  6. Worked example with step-by-step explanation
**Text on Screen**: Each section as you scroll:
```
• Definition & Characteristics
• Pseudocode & JavaScript Code
• Flow Diagram (Mermaid)
• Real-World Use Cases
• Worked Example
```
**Voiceover**:
> "The Notes section has everything. First, a clear definition of the algorithm. Then pseudocode followed by actual working JavaScript code. Next, a flow diagram showing how the algorithm makes decisions. Real-world examples like GPS routing and game AI show where these algorithms actually work in production. Finally, worked examples with step-by-step explanations help you see exactly how the algorithm executes on a real problem."

#### Slide 3: Examine One Use Case (2:50-3:00)
**Visual**: 
- Highlight one use case (e.g., "BFS: Social Network Analysis")
- Read the description on screen
**Text on Screen**: Show the use case example
**Voiceover**:
> "For example, BFS is used in social networks to find degrees of separation between people. You can read these real-world applications and see yourself how algorithms that seemed academic actually power the apps you use daily."

---

### **SECTION 5: FEATURE 3 - TEXT-TO-SPEECH & CONTROLS (0:45)**

#### Slide 1: Finding TTS (3:00-3:15)
**Visual**: 
- Look at the Explanation Panel

#### Slide 2: Demo TTS (3:15-3:30)
**Visual**: 
- Click the speaker icon
- Listen to audio playing (show visual feedback - maybe a pulse animation)
- Wait 2-3 seconds of audio
- Click stop
**Text on Screen**: "Audio Explanation Playing"
**Voiceover**:
> "Click speak, and listen. You can adjust the speed from 0.5x to 1.5x depending on how fast you want explanations. Stop it anytime with a single click."

#### Slide 3: Playback Controls (3:30-3:45)
**Visual**: 
- Scroll up in right sidebar to show PlaybackControls
- Show STEP button (highlighted in cyan)
- Show PLAY/PAUSE button
- Show RESET button
**Text on Screen**: "Execute Step-by-Step"
**Voiceover**:
> "The playback controls let you have complete control. Use the STEP button to move one step at a time - perfect for analyzing exactly what the algorithm is doing. Play to run full speed. Pause anytime to inspect. And reset to start over. Every control is designed for learning, not just watching."

---

### **SECTION 6: FEATURE 4 - ALGORITHM COMPARISON TABLE (0:45)**

#### Slide 1: Accessing Comparison (3:45-4:00)
**Visual**: 
- In right sidebar, click the "Compare" tab (GitCompare icon)
**Text on Screen**: "Algorithm Comparison Table"
**Voiceover**:
> "One of the most powerful features is the Comparison tab. This shows you all four algorithms side-by-side across 20+ criteria."

#### Slide 2: Showing the Comparison (4:00-4:20)
**Visual**: 
- Scroll through the comparison table showing columns:
  - BFS (Cyan)
  - DFS (Purple)
  - Dijkstra (Amber)
  - A* (Green)
- Show various rows:
  - Data Structure
  - Time Complexity
  - Space Complexity
  - When to Use
  - Best For
  - Exam Popularity
**Text on Screen**: Show categories scrolling by
**Voiceover**:
> "Each algorithm gets its own column, color-coded for easy scanning. Look at data structures - BFS uses queues, DFS uses stacks. Look at complexity - some are O(V+E), others depend on heuristics. Look at use cases - when do you pick one algorithm over another? This table answers all those questions."

#### Slide 3: Highlight One Row (4:20-4:30)
**Visual**: 
- Point to "When to Use" row
- Show the different answers for each algorithm
**Text on Screen**: "Comparison Criteria"
**Voiceover**:
> "This is gold for interview prep. You can see instantly that BFS finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs, Dijkstra handles weighted graphs, and A-star is the fastest when you have a goal direction. These insights separate mediocre answers from expert ones."

## 💡 Contingency Planning

### If Something Goes Wrong:

**App Not Loading?**
- Have a backup recording of the app working
- Or restart npm run dev before starting
- Keep terminal visible to troubleshoot if needed

**Network Fails Mid-Recording?**
- All features work offline except LeetCode links
- You can explain the LeetCode feature without it loading

**Audio Cuts Out?**
- Re-record that section alone and edit it in
- Keep a backup mic ready
- Test audio levels before each section

**Screen Recording Stutters?**
- Close unnecessary applications
- Use a simpler recording tool if current one lags
- Record in segments and stitch together
